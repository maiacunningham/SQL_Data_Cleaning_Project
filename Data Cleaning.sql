-- 2. Standardize Data

SELECT * 
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;

-- let's take a look at these
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE company LIKE 'Bally%';
-- nothing wrong here
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE company LIKE 'airbnb%';


-- should set the blanks to nulls ...
UPDATE world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
SET industry = NULL
WHERE industry = '';

-- now check those are all null

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;

-- populate those nulls

UPDATE layoffs_staging2 t1
JOIN layoffs_staging2 t2
ON t1.company = t2.company
SET t1.industry = t2.industry
WHERE t1.industry IS NULL
AND t2.industry IS NOT NULL;


SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;

-- ---------------------------------------------------

SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET industry = 'Crypto'
WHERE industry IN ('Crypto Currency', 'CryptoCurrency');

SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;

-- --------------------------------------------------


SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

-- we have some "United States" and some "United States." with a period at the end
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY country;

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET country = TRIM(TRAILING '.' FROM country);

-- fixed
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY country;


-- fix the date columns:
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

-- use str to date to update this field
UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET `date` = STR_TO_DATE(`date`, '%m/%d/%Y');

-- convert the data type properly
ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
MODIFY COLUMN `date` DATE;


SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;





-- 3. Look at Null Values

-- the null values in total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, and funds_raised_millions all look normal. I don't think I want to change that
-- I like having them null because it makes it easier for calculations during the EDA phase

-- so there isn't anything I want to change with the null values




-- 4. remove any columns and rows we need to

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL;


SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

-- Delete Useless data we can't really use
DELETE FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

SELECT * 
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
DROP COLUMN row_num;


SELECT * 
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;
